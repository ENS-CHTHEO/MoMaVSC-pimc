### Utility:
This code serves to perform Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations on a simple model of matter under Vibrational Strong Coupling. The model under consideration is a set of one-dimensional oscillators that can be described either by Morse potentials or by harmonic potentials. A linear Hamiltonian coupling scheme of a QED-consistent Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian coupling can be selected.

### Files:
The src directory cotains the files that compose the software. The scripts file includes bash scripts that make it easier to put the code into production as well as to analyze the results.
